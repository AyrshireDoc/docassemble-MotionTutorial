# docassemble-tutorial-motion
A simple example of a Docassemble interview that automates a Word document to create a motion to dismiss.
Created by [Quinten Steenhuis](https://github.com/nonprofittechy) and [Rina Padua](https://github.com/Rinapadua).

This tutorial has been updated to make use of features in Docassemble Version 0.2.39 and should work with any later version.

## How to use this tutorial
You can use this demo repository to learn the basics of creating a guided interview in Docassemble with a best-practices workflow for an individual or a small team. There are many ways to use Docassemble. When you complete this tutorial you will understand how to:

* Use a Microsoft Word document as a template for your guided interview
* Use child templates
* Make use of built-in Docassemble features for legal documents
* Use version control in Docassemble

You can use Docassemble without setting up GitHub or Google Drive. Google Drive makes the process of editing Microsoft Word templates much easier and more natural. GitHub integration [will help you](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/desktop-gui/basics/why-use-version-control) better work in a team, recover from mistakes in your code, and offer a helpful backup of your work at different points in time.

### Getting started
Follow the excellent Docassemble documentation for these first few steps:

1. [Install Docassemble](https://docassemble.org/docs/docker.html). If you just want to try out Docassemble, we recommend installing Docassemble on your laptop or workstation with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You may need to [enable virtualization extensions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000007139/server-products.html) in your computer's BIOS settings to run Docker.
1. Create a new account on [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and [Google](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp) if you don't already have accounts on both platforms.
1. Enable [GitHub](https://docassemble.org/docs/installation.html#github) and 
  [Google Drive Sync](https://docassemble.org/docs/installation.html#google%20drive) integration.
1. Add your GitHub and Google accounts from the Profile menu in Docassemble.
1. [Fork](https://github.com/GBLSMA/docassemble-tutorial-motion#fork-destination-box) [this repository](https://github.com/nonprofittechy/docassemble-tutorial-motion) and [pull](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#packages) the forked repository into your playground from Folders | Packages menu. Make sure you pull the repository that you created by *forking* this repository. Forking will make a copy of the repository that you can update and change as much as you like.

### Configure Microsoft Word to work with Docassemble
To prevent problems, it's recommended that you [turn off automatic smart quotes](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-curly-quotes-to-straight-quotes-and-vice-versa-017963a0-bc5f-486b-9c9d-0ec511a8fb8f) while creating templates in Microsoft Word for Docassemble. Instructions vary. In recent versions of Word, you can turn off smart quotes by clicking File | Options | Proofing, selecting Autocorrect and uncheck the box "Smart quotes with straight quotes" under "Replace as you type" on both the Autoformat and Autoformat as you type tabs.
